# üéÅ Abstraction

# üöÄ A class with one or more abstract method is known as abstract class. A method without body or method with only declaration is know as abstract method. We can't make object of an abstract class and we must override abstract methods in subclass.

''' In Python we can't implement this feature directly. We have to use a module abc (abstract base class).

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    # function declaration
    @abstractmethod
    def drive(self):
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    # function definition
    def drive(self):
        return "you drive this car."

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    # function definition
    def drive(self):
        return "you drive this motorcycle."
    
# usage
car = Car()
print(car.drive())  # you drive this car.

motorcycle = Motorcycle()
print(motorcycle.drive())   # you drive this motorcycle.
